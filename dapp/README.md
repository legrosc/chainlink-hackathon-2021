The decentralized insurance as a service.  
Build an insurance smart contract in minutes! ðŸš€

## How to launch the app

1. Clone the repository with `git clone`.
2. Run `npm install` to install the node modules.
3. Run `npm run hh:start`. This will launch a local Ethereum network using [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/). You should see a list of generated test accounts in your terminal. 
4. Run `npm hh:deploy`. This will deploy the smart contract to the local blockchain network.
5. Finally, run `npm run start` to launch the Angular app, and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

To use the app, you need to install the Metamask extension in your preferred web browser. After creating your account, you can interact with the app using your own address or by using one of the accounts generated by hardhat:
1. Pick one of the accounts displayed after running the command `npm run hh:start`, and copy its private key.
2. In Metamask, [import the account](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489331-How-to-import-an-Account) using the private key.
3. Choose the `Localhost 8545` network in Metamask.
4. You now have a test account with 1000 ethers.

**Note**: If you make some transactions using a test account, and later restart the hardhat development network (and thus reset the accounts), you will need to [reset the account](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015488891-Resetting-an-Account) in Metamask. This will clear your transaction history. Otherwise, the nonce (the number of transactions sent from the address) of the Metamask account won't match the nonce of the address on the network, and you will get errors when trying to make transactions.
